# Learning PHP

This is intended to be an turn-key environment for learning PHP on a Mac. 

# Getting Started

### Install Vagrant

[Getting Started](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html)

### Install VirtualBox

[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

### Create Your Environment

First you will need to clone this project:

```
git clone git@github.com:alsbury/learning-php.git
```

Then change directory to the repo you just checkout out:

```
cd learning-php
```

Then build your VM:

```
vagrant up
```

Then SSH into your new VM:
```
vagrant ssh
```

To exit the VM:

```
exit
```

To halt the VM:

```
vagrant halt
```

To Destroy your VM:
```
vagrant destroy
```

### Install an IDE

- [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) - Best PHP IDE, but also costs $$. If you are serious, it's well worth the investment. 
- [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/) - Another great PHP IDE. Not quite as nice as PhpStorm, but it's free.
